TODO before PR:

 - Change curve to chamfer in tension arms.
 - Streamline the shape of the top of the ducts to avoid overhangs, especially around the fan retaining notch.
 - Increase clearance for fan retaining notch at top. (~1mm should be sufficient.)
 - Add chamfer to the internal plastic lips on the cartridge where it mates with the ducts, so that the supports can be removed.
